# Nand2tetris files

* this'll probably just end up being a collection of hdl files ill end up writing on my way through Nand2tetris, got some notes ill keep in here as well. i'm just running symlinks from the project files so as i go each week ill add the weeks files and whatnot.

* made an edit to the strucutre so id have .tst files and .cmp files here as well and also in dirs effectively, figured itd get messy as the course went on and also that the course creators probably had a reason they set the dirs out how they did


#### for future modules and symlinking them
> ln -fP ~/programs/nand2tetris/projects/01/* ~/code/learn/nand2tetris/01
